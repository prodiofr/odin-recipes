        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift recipe collection from a very dear friend. It is rich, aromatic, flavorful and makes A LOT. So please grab the biggest pot you can find. I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta dishes.</em></p>
